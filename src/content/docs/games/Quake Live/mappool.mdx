A crucial part of customizing your Quake Live server on Game Host Bros is setting up a specific map pool. This guide explains how to configure your map pool and, if desired, lock your server to a single gametype.

## Accessing The mappool.txt File

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your Quake 3 Arena server.
3. In the sidebar click on `Management > File Manager`.
4. Select the `baseq3` folder.
5. Open the `mappool.txt` file.

By default there are some pre-configured mappool files for you to use. They can be changed by setting `Map Pool` in `Configuration > Startup Parameters` to one of the files below.

| Game Mode     | Config                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Default | mappool.txt |
| FFA | mappool_ffa.txt |
| Clan Arena | mappool_ca.txt |
| Capture the Flag | mappool_ctf.txt |
| Duel | mappool_duel.txt |
| Race | mappool_race.txt |
| Team Deathmatch | mappool_tdm.txt |

## Understanding Map Pool Entries

The `mappool.txt` file determines the maps available for play on the server.

- Entries follow the format: `map|factory`
    - 'map' refers to the map name.
    - 'factory' refers to the game type or rule set for that map.

Ensure each `map|factory` pair is on its own line. Refer to the default 'mappool.txt' provided for examples. If you're using custom factories (custom game settings/rules), specify them in the 'mappool.txt' file. Properly configured, these will appear in the map voting system at each game’s end.

You can specify a different map pool file by setting `Map Pool` in `Configuration > Startup Parameters` to the path of your custom map pool file. Simply make a copy of the default map pool file and rename it.

## Locking Server to a Single Gametype

If you prefer to keep your server dedicated to one game type (e.g., Duel), ensure your 'mappool.txt' contains only maps from the desired factory. Add `8` to `g_voteFlags` in your `server.cfg` file. This adjustment disables the "callvote map" option's factory argument, locking in the gametype.
