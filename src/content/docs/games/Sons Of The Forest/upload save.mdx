In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of uploading an existing world and player save file to your Sons Of The Forest dedicated server.

If you get stuck at any time, Game Host Bros offers free save transfers. Just reach out to a bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr)

You **MUST** convert any single player save to a multiplayer save on your local PC first before uploading it to your server. Doing this means the host doesn't keep their inventory so store it or give it to a friend first.

## Locating your existing Sons Of The Forest save files
To start we first need to get your existing save file from your local PC.

1. Press `Win + R` on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.
2. Copy and paste `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\SinglePlayer` into the Run window and press OK.
3. Here you will see a folder with random numbers, inside this folder you will find your `SaveData.zip`.

## Convert your single player save to a multiplayer save.

1. After you've completed the above and copied your `SaveData.zip` file, move it to `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\Multiplayer`.
2. Open Sons of the forest and click `Multiplayer > Host Game > Continue > Load Game`, and select the world you want and click `Start`.
3. Once in the game manually save the game using a Tarp or Tent and then close the game.
4. Navigate to `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\Multiplayer` and copy the newly created save.

## Uploading your existing Sons Of The Forest save to your server

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Sons Of The Forest server.
2. In the Game Host Bros panel go to `Managment > File Manager`
3. Once there navigate to `/serverconfig/Saves/DedicatedServer/Multiplayer/0000000001` and delete all the `SaveData.zip` inside (back this up if you want to save this world).
4. [Upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/) your latest `SaveData.zip` file.
5. Start your server.
