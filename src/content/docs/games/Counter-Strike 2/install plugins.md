Using our Mod Manager, you can get Metamod, CounterStrikeSharp and some plugins installed on your CS2 server with a single click.

:::danger
Metamod and CounterStrikeSharp both must be installed before any other plugin.
:::

## Installing Metamod & CounterStrikeSharp

The first thing you need to do is to install Metamod Source. This is the base foundation that most plugins use.

1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your server.
3. In the left-hand menu, click `Tools > Mod Manager`.
4. Look for `Metamod Source` & `CounterStrikeSharp`.
![Game Host Bros Mod Manager Screenshot](../../../../assets/guide-images/mod-manager.png)
5. Click the Install buttons for both then restart the server.

At Game Host Bros, we automatically update Metamod & CounterStrikeSharp every time your server starts.

## Installing Plugins

We have some CounterStrikeSharp plugins already added to our 1-click Mod Manager.

1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your server.
3. In the left-hand menu, click `Tools > Mod Manager`.
4. Look for the plugin you want to install.
5. Click the Install button then restart the server.

You can check if the plugin is loaded by typing `css_plugins list` into the console. If you manually need to install a plugin, the most common folder you need to upload them to is `/game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins`.

## CS2 Plugins List

Here is a list of all the current Counter-Strike 2 plugins you can manually install on your server.
