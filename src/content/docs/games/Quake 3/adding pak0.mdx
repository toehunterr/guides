Due to legal restrictions, server owners must supply their own "pak0.pk3" files. These files contain essential elements like maps, textures, sound effects, and other game data.

You can find this file within your original Quake 3 Arena CD-ROM. Specifically, look in the `Quake3/baseq3` directory of the CD-ROM. Alternatively, you can purchase and download a legitimate copy of [Quake 3 Arena from GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/quake_iii_arena). After purchasing, download and locate the `pak0.pk3` file in the game's directory.

## Uploading the pak0.pk3 File to Your Server

1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your Quake 3 Arena server.
3. On the sidebar, click `Management > File Manager` from the drop-down menu.
4. Navigate to the `.q3a/baseq3` folder.
5. Drag and drop your "pak0.pk3" file from your computer, or use an FTP client to upload the file.

## Adding Additional Patch Data for ioquake Users

If you're running an ioquake client, additional patch data is necessary for clients to connect to your Quake 3 Arena server.

1. Visit [ioquake Patch Data](https://ioquake3.org/extras/patch-data/) to download the latest patch files.
2. Extract the files (usually in .pak format) from the archive.
3. Go back to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) file manager, following the same steps as above.
4. Upload the extracted patch files to the `.q3a/baseq3` folder, similar to the "pak0.pk3" file process.
