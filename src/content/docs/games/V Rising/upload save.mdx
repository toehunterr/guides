## Locating your existing V Rising save files
To start we first need to get your existing save file from your local PC.

1. Press `Win + R` on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.
2. Copy and paste `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Stunlock Studios\VRising\CloudSaves` into the Run window and press OK.
3. Here you will see a folder with random numbers, inside this folder you will find your `AutoSave` file, `SessionId.json` and `StartDate.json` file.

## Uploading your existing V Rising save to your server

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your V Rising server.
2. In the Game Host Bros panel go to `Managment > File Manager`
