The easiest way to edit game settings on your Soulmask server is to use the in admin menu. To use this you **must** have already [setup an admin password](/games/soulmask/adding-admins/) on your Soulmask server.

1. Open Soulmask and connect to your server.
2. Once connected open press `~` tilde on your keyboard.
3. Type `gm key YOUR-ADMIN-PASSWORD`. It should now load the admin menu.
4. In the window, type the password again and click `Become the admin`. Now you have access to all the settings of the server.
6. Click `Open coefficient settings` and adjust the settings to what you desire.

Before restarting your server, wait for the auto-save to finish, so your settings are saved. This takes 7 minutes by default.
